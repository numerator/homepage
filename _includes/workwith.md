I am always looking for passionate, committed, insightful, talented, and inquisitive students to work with me on research. If you are a current University of Michigan student interested in getting involved in research, please feel free to get in touch.

If you are interested in pursuing a PhD under my supervision, you should apply to the PhD program in either the School of Information or Computer Science and Engineering (I have appointments in both units). Be sure to mention that you would like to work with me in your Statement of Purpose (and why!), and I will be sure to review your application. You are also welcome to send me an email introducing yourself, but be warned that I generally do not reply to introductions or questions from students who have not yet been admitted.
