My research seeks to develop principles, methods, and tools to guide the design of ubiquitous computing applications (i.e., applications and systems that incorporate mobile, IoT, and “smart” technology at their core). From early work in end-user configuration of complex environments to more recent work in smart home interaction and personal informatics for health, I have contributed over fifty peer-reviewed articles to the scientific literature in Human-Computer Interaction, Ubiquitous Computing, and Health Informatics. My work draws upon a variety of methods, most prominently featuring qualitative research for gaining a deep understanding of users in particular domains, design, prototyping, and software development for embodying novel design approaches, and small-to-medium-scale field deployments to evaluate novel designs in use. I also employ experimental methods, research through design, online ethnography, crowd-based approaches, and machine learning needed.

I have worked in a variety of application areas, including home entertainment, sustainable smart homes, accessible technology, and workplace collaboration. At present, my primary area of interest is mobile and smart health, where I am developing techniques to more effectively incorporate personal health data (a.k.a. patient-generated data) into both formal and informal health care settings. In this work, I am collaborating with researchers from a variety of disciplines, including medicine, engineering, and public health. For more information about my research, please see list of selected publications by topic area and/or my Google Scholar profile (for a mostly-complete list of my publications). If you are interested in a paper but aren’t able to access it through the publisher’s site or an academic article database, you can check Research Gate to see if a full-text is available there and request one if it’s not. I’ll try to respond to the request.
