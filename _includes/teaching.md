I have taught a number of courses within the School of Information. A full list is below. In addition, I have been deeply involved in several curriculum development efforts, including the overhaul of the HCI/UX curriculum for the MSI degree (2011-2012), the design of the Designing the User Experience track for the BSI degree (2012-2013), the transition of the MSI degree to a mastery-based curriculum (2015-2017), the initial design (2015-2016) and revision (2019) of the programming curriculum for the BSI, MSI, and MHI degrees, the launch of the User Experience Research & Design MicroMasters on edX (2016) (which has since re-launched as the User Experience Research & Design Specialization on Coursera (2019)), and the initiation of a Graduate Certificate in Augmented and Virtual Reality for the Rackham Graduate School at U-M (2017-2019).
